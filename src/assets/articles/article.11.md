Can we render **a table?** Let's find out!

<table>
<tr>
<th>Column 1</th>
<th>Column 2</th>
<th>Column 3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>R1C1</td>
<td>R1C2</td>
<td>R1C3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>R2C1</td>
<td>R2C2</td>
<td>R2C3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>R3C1</td>
<td>R3C2</td>
<td>R3C3</td>
</tr>
</table>

Looks like it worked... **yay!!**
