\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{What is Alshayun?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Alshayun} is a mobile application for delivering articles
            consisting of rich text and interactive \textbf{applet}s to
            \textbf{reader}s.
        \item \textbf{Alshayun} is designed for three actors in mind (a user is
            any of them):
            \begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries Content Author}]
                \item[Content Author] A \textbf{content author} is anyone who
                    has anything that they would like to write.
                \item[Reader] A \textbf{reader} is anyone who would like to read
                    what one or more \textbf{content author}s have to say.
                \item[Developer] A \textbf{developer} is anyone capable of
                    developing \textbf{applet}s and other functionality of
                    \textbf{Alshayun} that \textbf{content author}s and
                    \textbf{reader}s can use.
            \end{description}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Inspiration}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item My fascination with Bézier curves led me to the Internet.
        \item I discovered the article
            \href{https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/}{A Primer on Bézier
            Curves} by Pomax.
        \item I was intrigued by the interactive \textbf{applet}s weaved
            seamlessly throughout the text.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{figure}
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/pomax.png}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Example \textbf{applet}s from \textit{A Primer on Bézier
        Curves}}
    \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{About the Name}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item At inception, \textbf{Alshayun} was planned to be a mathematics
            education platform.
        \item I built a more general platform, but kept the original ``mathy'' name.
        \item
            \begin{center}
                \textbf{Origins of Algebra} \\
                Arabic (``al-jabr'')\textrightarrow Spanish\textrightarrow
                Latin\textrightarrow English
            \end{center}
        \item Arabic ``al-shayun'' appeared frequently in the original algebraic
            documents and means ``the unknown thing''; it became the ``x'' in
            Latin/English-speaking algebra (see
            \href{https://cosmosmagazine.com/mathematics/why-x-marks-unknown-0}{Why
            X marks the unknown} by Terry Moore).

    \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Caching Strategy}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Articles are broken into two pieces: metadata and text.
        \item The metadata of all articles is stored in a single manifest
            represented in \textbf{JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)} and
            consists of:
            \begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries
                    Excerpt}]
                \item[id] A unique, monotonically-increasing integer.
                \item[title] The title of the article.
                \item[tags] Zero or more taxonomic tags.
                \item[excerpt] A short (one sentence) description of the article.
            \end{description}
        \item Text is the full article text stored separately from the manifest
            and represented in
            \href{https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/}{Markdown}.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{figure}
    \begin{verbatim}
[
  {
    "id": 12,
    "title": "Towers of Hanoi",
    "excerpt": "Learn about the Towers of Hanoi...",
    "tags": [
      "algorithms"
    ]
  }
]
    \end{verbatim}
    \caption{Excerpt of article manifest in \textbf{JSON}}
    \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Applets}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Applet}s are the crux of \textbf{Alshayun}.
        \item \textbf{Applet}s are written in \textbf{TypeScript} and
            implemented as \textbf{Angular} components that extend an
            \textbf{Applet} superclass. \textbf{Angular} is a
            \textbf{TypeScript} Web framework.
        \item The superclass provides a \textbf{Hypertext Markup Language
            (HTML)} canvas tag and drawing context, implements an animation
            loop, and provides an extensible toolbar.
        \item \textbf{Applet}s are included in articles via an \texttt{<applet>}
            \textbf{HTML} tag with extensible properties.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{figure}
    \begin{verbatim}
<applet name="sort"
        width="50%"
        data-method="insertion"
        data-num-bars="50"></applet>

\section{Quick n' Dirty Server (QDS)}

\begin{frame}{What is the QDS?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{QDS} is a stand-alone Web application that allows
            \textbf{content author}s to create and manage articles.
        \item The \textbf{QDS} consists of two components: a \textbf{backend}
            and a \textbf{frontend}.
        \item The \textbf{QDS} is completely containerized with
            \textbf{Singularity} to simplify building and deployment.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Backend}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Written in \textbf{Flask}, the \textbf{backend} serves two
            functions: deliver articles to \textbf{Alshayun} and expose a
            \textbf{Representational State Transfer (REST)} interface to the
            \textbf{frontend}.
        \item \textbf{Flask} is a \textbf{Python} framework for designing
            \textbf{REST}-ful interfaces.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{figure}
    \begin{verbatim}
@app.route('/articles/<path:filename>')
def get_article(filename):
    return send_from_directory('articles/', filename)
    \end{verbatim}
    \caption{\textbf{QDS} interface to serve static articles}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{figure}
    \begin{verbatim}
@app.route('/article', methods = ['POST'])
def create_article():
    article = {}
    article['id'] = checkout_serial()
    # ... finish populating article object ...
    f = open('articles/article.' + \
        str(article['id']) + '.md', 'w')
    f.write(str(request.json['text']))
    f.close()
    # ... add article object to manifest ...
    \end{verbatim}
    \caption{Excerpt of \textbf{QDS} interface to dynamically create articles}
    \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Frontend}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{frontend} is written as a stand-alone \textbf{Angular}
            application.
        \item The \textbf{frontend} communicates with the \textbf{backend} over
            TCP/IP via the \textbf{REST}ful interface the \textbf{backend}
            exposes. Therefore, the \textbf{frontend} and \textbf{backend} can
            be on different servers.
        \item The \textbf{frontend} allows for the creation and management of
            articles.
        \item The \textbf{frontend} features a live preview of rendered articles
            as the \textbf{content author} writes them in Markdown.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Production Considerations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{QDS} is for development purposes and is not
            production-ready without at least the following additional steps:
        \item
            \begin{itemize}[font=$\bullet$\scshape\bfseries]
            \item Configure a real Web server (Nginx, Apache) to back the
                \textbf{frontend} and \textbf{backend}.
            \item Use a Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) module for
                interfacing with the \textbf{Flask} code.
            \item Set up Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates and force HTTPS
                for all communication.
            \item Develop an authentication wall around the \textbf{REST}ful
                interface of the \textbf{backend}.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item During initial development, I packaged articles into the Android
            Package (APK) file of \textbf{Alshayun}.
        \item This temporary solution hindered the production-readiness of the
            application.
        \item To improve the quality of the implementation, I set up an Nginx
            Web server on my desktop and hosted articles there.
        \item I wanted everything necessary to build, run, and test
            \textbf{Alshayun} to be included in the source code with detailed
            instructions.
        \item The \textbf{QDS} was born.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Technologies Used}

\begin{frame}{Node.js}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Node.js (Node)} is a \textbf{JavaScript} runtime designed
            mainly to facilitate writing scalable, server-side software in
            \textbf{JavaScript}.
        \item \textbf{Node} was first released in May of 2009.
        \item \textbf{Node} has received much attention and both praise and
            criticism from developers.
        \item The \textbf{Node Package Manager (NPM)} was released in January of
            2010 to facilitate publishing and installing \textbf{Node} packages.
        \item \textbf{NPM} has transcended its original intent to become a
            general-purpose \textbf{JavaScript} package manager.
        \item \textbf{Alshayun} doesn't use \textbf{Node} directly but is
            heavily dependant on \textbf{NPM}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{TypeScript}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{TypeScript} is a superset of \textbf{JavaScript} that
            compiles into \textbf{JavaScript}.
        \item \textbf{TypeScript} introduces type safety and true
            object-oriented programming constructs to \textbf{JavaScript} such
            as classes, access modifiers, and inheritance.
        \item The \textbf{TypeScript} compiler is available for installation via
            \textbf{NPM}.
        \item \textbf{Alshayun} is mostly written in \textbf{TypeScript}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Angular}
    \begin{itemize}[font=$\bullet$\scshape\bfseries]
        \item is a Web-application framework developed by Google and written in
            \textbf{TypeScript}.
        \item is relatively new (ca. September 2016), but it is based on a
            rewrite of its older predecessor, AngularJS.
        \item is useful for developing responsive, single-page Web applications.
        \item comes with a suite of development tools for writing, building,
            testing, and deploying applications.
        \item is designed around the \textbf{Model-View-Controller (MVC)} design
            pattern.
        \item is available for installation via \textbf{NPM}.
        \item provides a built-in development server for prototyping purposes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ionic}
    \begin{itemize}[font=$\bullet$\scshape\bfseries]
        \item is a framework for building cross-platform applications in
            \textbf{HTML}, \textbf{CSS}, and \textbf{JavaScript}.
        \item supports developing an application with a single codebase that
            deploys to Web, Android, and iOS devices.
        \item is divorced from an underlying \textbf{JavaScript} framework as of
            version 4, but support for \textbf{Angular} is strong.
        \item provides a collection of \textbf{HTML} tags and \textbf{Angular}
            components that generate Web components in similar style to
            \href{https://getbootstrap.com/}{Bootstrap}.
        \item is the high-level framework that \textbf{Alshayun} is written in,
            backed by \textbf{Angular}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cordova}
    \begin{itemize}[font=$\bullet$\scshape\bfseries]
        \item is an Apache project that provides a uniform interface for
            generating device-dependent code for Android and iOS.
        \item provides, e.g., a \textbf{JavaScript} interface for interacting
            with the built-in camera of mobile devices.
        \item is a vital part of \textbf{Ionic} that allows \textbf{Ionic} to
            generate its platform-dependent code from a single codebase.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Flask}
    \begin{itemize}[font=$\bullet$\scshape\bfseries]
        \item is a \textbf{Python} framework for the rapid development of
            \textbf{REST}ful \textbf{Application Programming Interface (API)}s.
        \item allows developers to prefix \textbf{Python} functions with
            decorators indicating the URL endpoint that triggers the function,
            the acceptable HTTP methods, and more.
        \item provides a collection of helpful methods for generating HTTP
            responses, handling exceptions, and processing HTTP request data.
        \item provides a built-in development server for prototyping purposes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Singularity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Singularity} is containerization software that allows
            users to develop, package, and relocate full-fledged compute
            environments consisting of an operating system and software binaries
            and libraries.
        \item \textbf{Alshayun} consists of three \textbf{Singularity}
            containers I've developed: one for the \textbf{Ionic} development
            environment, one for the \textbf{QDS} \textbf{backend}, and another
            for the \textbf{QDS} \textbf{frontend}.
        \item Check out a previous
            \href{https://youtu.be/NeTRm7_JwX8}{Introduction to Singularity
            Containers} presentation I gave at Keeping Current Seminar for more
            information.

\section{Use Cases}

\begin{frame}{Classroom Auxiliary Content}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item K--12 schools and universities may find \textbf{Alshayun} to be
            useful.
        \item For example, independent classrooms can run their own articles
            servers (\textbf{QDS}).
        \item Students may be notified of which articles server to use in their
            copy of \textbf{Alshayun}.
        \item Teachers may write helpful articles or lecture notes making use of
            \textbf{applet}s if desired.
        \item Access to articles servers could be restricted to the campus
            network.
        \item The tagging feature of \textbf{Alshayun} could be useful for
            organizing subjects.
        \item This use case was my main focus when designing \textbf{Alshayun}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Starter Mobile Blog}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Alshayun} can allow an upcoming blogger to quickly build a
            blog without building a lot of infrastructure.
        \item \textbf{Alshayun} would be useful for blogs if it were to become a
            more general and widely used platform like a Really Simple
            Syndication (RSS) reader.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Future Work}

\begin{frame}{User Accounts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I want to allow \textbf{reader}s to save or bookmark articles,
            comment on articles, and synchronize their personalized settings
            between devices.
        \item This requires an overhaul of the \textbf{QDS} and carries security
            and privacy concerns.
        \item Accounts need roles so that \textbf{content author}s can also
            write and publish articles and manage access permissions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cloud Hosting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A central production \textbf{Alshayun} server hosted on the cloud
            (i.e., Amazon Web Services, Google, Azure) would be nice.
        \item This would be useful as the default articles server.
        \item I imagine this feature could spiral into a larger content delivery
            platform, although the feature to host a local \textbf{QDS} would
            still be a plus.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Power Efficiency}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{applet}s are power-hungry.
        \item I need to work on more caching and accessing the network only when
            necessary.
        \item Also, I should unload computationally intensive \textbf{applet}s
            when they are not being used and lazily load as much content as
            possible without sacrificing too much application performance.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Learning Outcomes}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I learned the essentials of \textbf{TypeScript}, \textbf{Angular},
            and \textbf{Ionic}.
        \item I fell in love with \textbf{Angular}.
        \item My favorite feature of \textbf{Angular} was ``observables.''
        \item The biggest challenge I faced was getting  the dynamic
            \textbf{applet}s generated from Markdown working correctly.
        \item I have since begun working on an \textbf{Angular}-powered
